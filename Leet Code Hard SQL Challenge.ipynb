Your task is to write a SQL query to find all records for which there are 3 or more consecutive dates where the number of people exceeds 100.\n",

    "The given solution uses a sequence of common table expressions (CTEs) and window functions to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **cte1**: This CTE goes through each record in the `stadium` table. For rows where `no_of_people` is not greater than 100, it assigns a value of `1` to a new column `result`. For rows where `no_of_people` is greater than 100, it assigns a `null` value to `result`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **cte2**: This CTE calculates a cumulative count of non-null `result` values up to the current row (ordered by `visit_date`). It uses this count to group the rows. Rows that are not preceded by a row with `no_of_people` less than or equal to 100 will be in the same group. It then filters out the rows where `result` is not null.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The main query: It applies another window function over the result of cte2, counting the number of rows in each group (`cnt`). It then filters out the groups with a count less than 3. These are the groups that do not have at least 3 consecutive dates with `no_of_people` exceeding 100. The remaining groups represent periods of 3 or more consecutive days where `no_of_people` exceeded 100 each day.\n",

    "Understanding the days with high footfall (visitors exceeding 100 people for 3 or more consecutive days) is vital for stadium management. It helps in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Resource Management:** Management can plan for additional resources on high footfall days. For example, additional food and beverages may need to be ordered, or more security staff may need to be deployed.\n",
    "2. **Maintenance Schedule:** High footfall might mean more wear and tear. Hence, maintenance activities could be planned around these high footfall days to ensure a great experience for visitors.\n",
    "3. **Marketing and Promotions:** If there is a pattern in these high footfall days, special promotions or events could be organized to attract even more visitors. \n"

    "- Data Visualization: Data often needs to be in a specific format for it to be accurately represented in graphs or charts. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Analysis: Certain types of statistical analysis require data to be in a 'wide' format (i.e., each subject has a row and each measurement has a column). \n",
